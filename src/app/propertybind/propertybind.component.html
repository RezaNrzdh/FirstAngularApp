    <h3>Property Binding Component</h3>
    <p>In this component I used property binding instead of hard code in html file. you can see property binding below the line.</p>
    <label>I'm learning "{{ platformName }}".</label>
    <label>I didn't like it before. but now I like it.</label>
    <label>I'm the "{{ currentJobTitle }}" but "{{ month }}" month later, I will be "{{ currentJobTitle }}" and "{{ futureJobTitle }}".</label>
